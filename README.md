Animations for Telecon website, based on designs sent by Julien Sister by email

The hero animation is based on an 8x5 grid of squares, size determine by window
width.  Images will always appear in the same order, but this order can be changed
or even made random. Images are currently not centered in their divs.

Putting the mouse over any image will replace it with another random image from the 
same series at any time.

After a given time, the left, right, and top white bars will come in to cover the
outside layer of images.



After scrolling down, the logo on the left will go into 'fixed' mode and follow the
users screen, and fade in and out to highlight the different sections on the logo
before arriving at the bottom where all colors will be displayed.

Currently, clicking on any section of the logo at any point will bring you to
www.google.ca, but this can easily be changed to any link required, and can be
set to open in a new window.



Quick Notes:
